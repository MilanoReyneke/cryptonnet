Studying neural networks 


This project is a Python neural network that uses opening price data of a crypto-currency from the previous 14 days to predict if the closing price on a certain day will increase or decrease. This is done with the _predict_ function in the class _NeuralNet_. The project was a study in neural networks that allowed me to deepen my understanding of their functioning.
